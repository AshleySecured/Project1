# Project1
# System Security Lab: Active Directory in VirtualBox with Automated User Provisioning (PowerShell)

## About The Project 💡

Welcome to Project 1 of my System & Network Security series. In this project, I demonstrate how to build and secure a network from the ground up—showcasing the full process from initial setup to a hardened environment, all in real time.

## 🔧 Built With
#### Oracle VirtualBox  
– for creating and managing the virtualized lab environment

#### Windows Server 2019 ISO 
– to deploy and configure Active Directory

#### Windows 11 (host machine) 
– base operating system running the virtual environment

#### PowerShell 
– for automating user creation and administrative tasks

#### Networking Configurations (DHCP, DNS, RAS, NAT) 
– for setting up secure network services

## 🚀Getting Started

This project was originally inspired by Josh Madakor, who created an excellent walkthrough video on building a virtual Active Directory environment from start to finish. To gain a strong foundation, I first followed his tutorial step-by-step to understand the process.

After completing it once, I challenged myself to recreate the entire project from scratch—without referencing the walkthrough. In my YouTube video, you’ll see me apply what I learned, troubleshoot in real-time, and demonstrate my ability to independently build and secure the environment.

## ⚙️Installation

To get started, download the required programs to set up your virtual environment. If you don’t already have Windows, install Windows 10 or 11—either works fine.

Next, install Oracle VirtualBox to create a safe, sandboxed environment where you can experiment without affecting your main system. Don’t forget the Oracle VirtualBox Extension Pack, which adds extra features we’ll need later.

Once installed and configured correctly, your virtual machine should look like this:

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### ✅ Step 1: Set Up Host Environment

* 💻 Ensure **Windows 10 or 11** is installed
* 🛠️ Download and install **Oracle VirtualBox** and the **Extension Pack**

### ✅ Step 2: Create Virtual Machines

* 🖥️ Set up **Windows Server 2019 VM** for Active Directory
* 🖥️ Set up **Windows 11 VM** for client access and testing

### ✅ Step 3: Configure Networking

* 🌐 Establish internal network settings in VirtualBox
* 🔧 Configure DHCP, DNS, and other services for Active Directory

### ✅ Step 4: Install & Configure Active Directory

* 🏢 Promote the Windows Server VM to a **Domain Controller**
* 👤 Create and manage users and organizational units

### ✅ Step 5: Automate User Management

* ⚡ Use **PowerShell scripts** to add and manage users efficiently

### ✅ Step 6: Test & Validate Environment

* 🔍 Verify connectivity between VMs
* ✅ Test user logins, permissions, and AD policies
* 🛠️ Troubleshoot any configuration issues

### ✅ Step 7: Document & Demonstrate

* 🎥 Record a **YouTube walkthrough** recreating the environment from scratch
* 📝 Ensure all steps are clear, reproducible, and well-documented

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

A special thanks to Josh Madakor, whose original walkthrough video inspired this project. His tutorial provided a clear foundation for building a virtual Active Directory environment, which I first followed step-by-step before recreating it independently.
